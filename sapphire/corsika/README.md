CORSIKA Reader
--------------

This Python module makes it easier to work directly with the binary
output from [CORISKA](https://www.ikp.kit.edu/corsika/) simulations.

It has been adapted to work nice for data analysis in the
[HiSPARC](http://www.hisparc.nl/) Project.

Based on work by Javier Gonzalez.
A C++/Python version of CORSIKA reader he works on is here:
