class CoincidenceQuery(object):

    """Perform queries on an ESD file where coincidences have been analysed.

    Functions in this class build and perform queries to easily filter
    coincidences based on station participation and station
    organization. This assumes coincidences have been analysed using
    :class:`~sapphire.analysis.coincidences.CoincidencesESD`.

    First initiate the class so it can get the correct tables, then get
    coincidences using one of the functions (all_coincidences, any, all,
    at_least), then get the events for these coincidences using other
    functions (all_events, events_from_[stations, subcluster, cluster]).

    An exception will occur when you include a station in a query that
    does not occur in the datafile.

    Example usage::

        >>> from sapphire import CoincidenceQuery
        >>> cq = CoincidenceQuery('2013_8_1.h5')
        >>> coincidences = cq.all([501, 502, 503, 504], iterator=True)
        >>> events = cq.all_events(coincidences)
        >>> specific_events = cq.events_from_stations(coincidences,
        ...                                          [501, 502, 503, 504])
