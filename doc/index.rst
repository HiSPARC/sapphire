Welcome to SAPPHiRE's documentation!
====================================

SAPPHiRE is a Simulation and Analysis Program Package for HiSPARC Research
and Education.  This is your first stop if you want to download HiSPARC
station data, perform a simulation or start analyzing (simulated) data.

While SAPPHiRE currently is very capable, the documentation is still being
heavily developed.  Please check the `GitHub repository
<http://github.com/hisparc/sapphire/>`_ to view the activity log or browse
or download the code.
